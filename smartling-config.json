     //    authorizeContent - defines whether uploaded content will automatically be authorized for translation.
     //                       Possible values: "true" or "false". Default value is "true".
     //    pathRegex        - regular expression that filters resources to send to Smartling. It is required attribute.
     //                       Expression has groovy (Java 7) format. See http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html
     //                       Due to regex is located in JSON some special symbols must be double escaped. Example: "." must be double escaped "\\."
     //    translationPathExpression - groovy expression that is used to create a file path and name for translated files.
     //                                If this parameter is empty or undefined translated files won't be pushed back from Smartling to repository.

     //    translationCommitMessage  - groovy expression that defining a translation commit message. If it is empty or undefined default message will be used
     //    smartlingDirectives       - string array with additional Smartling directives. Allowed directives depend on resource type.
